Like most guys, I have always been interested in sports. As a child, I participated in soccer, basketball and baseball. However, it took until I was in high school for me to develop a passion for playing a sport. Playing golf has taught me the value of patience, perseverance, and discipline which I believe are attributes needed to lead a successful life.	I have played in cold, rainy, as well as hot sticky, and humid weather, getting up at 7:00 A.M. most summer days in order to improve. As a result, I developed a strong work ethic. Since golf is a gentlemans sport, it has reminded me of the importance of being respectful to other players and to be honest when it came to my score. As I have gotten older, I have learned that integrity is important in both establishing my own character as well as recognizing those I want to associate with.	The same principles that I apply in golf also apply to academics. Golf is a tough sport. A person frequently loses more than he wins; therefore, developing a positive and strong mental attitude of perseverance and resilience is very important. The importance of these traits is not limited to just golf, but are also important in academics and in life. 	The self discipline and perseverance I have learned through golf has helped me in school. Since I have ADHD, my mind tends to race at times. Golf has helped me with focus and regrouping for concentration purposes, which I have applied to my studies. Accomplishing goals in spite of obstacles, and developing the ability to learn from mistakes, are important tools to have academically and in life. I believe these skills will help me succeed at Newberry.	As a Lutheran, I understand the idea that we are given grace by God, in spite of our mistakes, and that we are to extend that grace to others. Sometimes, I am more successful in applying that belief than others. However, it is a goal to strive toward. I am looking forward to attending Newberry College because of the small classes and smaller collegiate atmosphere. I believe I will thrive better in this environment. While I will always have to contend with ADHD, I believe I will have a greater chance of success in small classes and because of the values I have developed in the areas of perseverance, resilience, discipline, and patience.  	I am starting to think about the future and how to prepare myself to be successful and be able to take care of a family one day. I enjoy discussing politics and current issues with my friends. I have begun to explore my interest in political issues by volunteering in campaigns and attending the S.C. Presidential Debate and S.C. Congressional Forum last year. I also have enjoyed taking marketing and business courses in high school and hope to be an entrepreneur one day. Business and social media courses offered at Newberry will help me prepare for that future. However, the above mentioned values and traits will be necessary to do well at Newberry and bridge the experiences there into a foundation for the future.
