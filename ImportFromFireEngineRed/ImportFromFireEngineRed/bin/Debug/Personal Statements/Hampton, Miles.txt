I thought about an essay subject several times and tried to decide what I would write about.  I talked to my parents to get some insight into what direction I should take.  They encouraged me to think about school and all the things that I have experienced since I began school.  I have a somewhat unique story, so I decided to share the experiences that I have had in school that have had an impact on me. I was originally homeschooled by my mom and did not begin public school until fifth grade.  I would not describe 5tth grade as a great experience because I was really quiet since I did not know anyone.  This made it harder to make friends and it took time to get to know other students and make friends.  Fortunately, some of the friends I made are still my friends today. During my first year in school, I noticed that I had a harder time in some subjects than other students in my class.  At first this upset me, but I realized that if I worked hard and did not quit, I could perform as well as the other students.My parents said that being involved in the orchestra and the band really allowed me to flourish as a student.  It is true that I enjoy music.  As a little kid, I could sit down and listen to music for hours, especially classical and Christian music. I began playing the violin in fifth grade and added the trumpet in middle School.  I practiced as much as I could, and I decided that I would apply the same commitment to my schoolwork that I applied to my instruments.  After Christmas of my sixth grade year, I decided that I wanted to make all A�s on my report card and that I would work as hard as I could until I made it happen.  I was especially determined to make an A in my math classes.  I knew this would be hard, but I was determined that I would be able to get this done.  I did not accomplish this in sixth grade and set my sights on the goal again in seventh grade.  It was in seventh grade that I met my favorite middle school teacher, Mr. Timothy Nelson.  Mr. Nelson was a tough teacher who did not believe in giving students good grades because they were nice. He believed that if you received a good grade it would have to be because you earned it.  He was willing to help students with their math whenever he had time.  I learned very quickly that if I needed help that I could get help from Mr. Nelson and that he would always be patient with me no matter how long it took me to understand.  Although, I did not make all A�s in seventh grade, I learned a great deal about math and about asking teachers for help.In eighth grade, I accomplished two important personal goals: I made All A�s on my report card and I also made 15th chair in the Allstate band.  Mr. George Wenger, my private trumpet instructor, was instrumental in helping me to make all-state band. Although I had only taken lessons from him for a few months, I grew immensely as a musician under his guidance.  He taught me a different way to articulate, to warm up, and to practice correctly.  I continue to take lessons from Mr. Wenger and I consider him to be more than just a teacher.  He is indeed a good friend.    I�ve found that hard work is extremely important especially as I complete my high school years, but I�ve learned that teachers really want to see me succeed. My ninth grade math teacher, Mrs. Neale, was an old fashioned teacher. She was smart, and although some people thought she was mean, I thought she was honest and helpful. She was an outstanding teacher in every way.  Whenever we prepared for tests, she gave us specific questions that we should study.  I wish I could have had her for other math classes.  She always tutored in the mornings, and I made it a point to be there.  I made an 86 in her class, and I worked for it.  She made things easy to understand.  She was always ready to help me and everyone else.  She made me like (enjoy) math while I took it from her and she had a positive impact on my idea of teachers. I know that I have been blessed.  I have faith in God to help me, but I understand that I have to work hard in order to be successful. I also understand that there is no shame in asking for help.  I am looking forward to the opportunity to attend Newberry College, work with its excellent instructors and professors, and once again prove that hard work, dedication, and determination are absolutely important to being successful in all that I do.
