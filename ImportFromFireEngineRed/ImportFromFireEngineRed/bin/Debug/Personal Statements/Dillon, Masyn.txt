The Best Things in Life are Free	Advice, you don’t have to pay a cent for it and it is one of those things that I seek out to find, or what I look for while I constantly endeavor my journeys in life. I was once told these few words of wisdom, “if you do what you have to do now, you can simply do what you want to do later.” If you wonder why that would be the best advice I’ve ever gotten it is simply because, it lets me know if you buckle down and get an education I can do anything I what to do later. That advice also taught me that education is the most important thing to have because no one can ever take that away from me.	Since I could remember, my parent’s advice has stuck with me and has given me hope. It’s that same bit of hope that keeps me alive in those never-ending school periods and extensive nights of homework. Finding myself thinking about all the things I could do in life such as; sail around the world, take a trip to where no man has landed or simply just owning a home and being able to support a family. All hose things are in my reach if I do what I am suppose to in school and get the education that is expected of me.  	Even now, having ambition and the education to accomplish things will get me to where ever I want to go in my life. Striving to achieve something that I may think is bigger than myself can easily be done. Simply because no one can take away what I worked for to be successful and that is your education. Maybe a job at the local school, bank, or wherever I find my niche, no one can ever step in my way because I have what it takes. 	The more I realize how fast I’m growing up, and how the importance of an education matters in today’s society, can be shocking to others, but not me. I am proud that my parents have instilled in me the value of an education and where it can take me. If you ask me, I’m ahead in today’s world simply because I was once told if you do what to have to now, you can do what you want later.
