As it stands I am eighteen, six feet eight inches, two hundred twenty pounds, muscular, confident, strong willed, athletic, articulate, and closer to God. Prior to the age of seventeen I did not possess any of these individual characteristics. I used to have low self esteem. There were times my prayer would revolve around me magically losing weight and being liked, but the time frames between prayers were so far apart that I completely forgot about the principle of prayer as well as just praying itself. Ultimately I was lost- not only in a sea of shame and loathing but lost in faith and as a human being.From age twelve to age sixteen I weighed two hundred ninety five pounds. I grew from five foot eleven to six foot four in that interval of time. The height helped to move the weight to other places. Just not enough to make me feel good about myself when I looked in the mirror. The most negative experience with my weight was when I walked passed a group of guys, without a shirt on for the first time, and as I walked they began to whisper about me, and laugh, one even said �Whoa! He is pretty fat�. Even though the statement offended me and damaged my self esteem dramatically .During my sophomore year I started participating in sports, reluctantly and much to my dismay. Only if I knew then that sports would help me become more athletic and give me an affinity for exercise. As I ran, and lifted weights toward the form I wanted my body to manifest I still felt a little lack of confidence- in short I was still lost.I went through the motions on a daily basis; I even started to gain weight again. I wanted to live the life of every other typical teen but that�s where I made a mistake, I�m not like everyone else I�m called to be different- to be in this world not of it. I kept telling myself that but it didnt motivate me enough to become a better Christian or to start exercising again so, I went to a four day youth camp that same summer courtesy of a church member. There I experienced a spiritual change like no other, it was at youth camp I became saved and dedicated my life to Christ- threw away all sinful nature and principles and picked up unalloyed standards to guide my life. As I began to follow these principles and read my Bible I began to understand who I was and what I am called to be. I am a flowing river of water overcoming any obstacles in my path , any obstacle that seems insurmountable I will build up the pressure needed to overpower it never returning to the same flow- only getting stronger and giving nourishment to all those that thirst. This is the principle that maintains my healthy state physically, mentally and spiritually.
