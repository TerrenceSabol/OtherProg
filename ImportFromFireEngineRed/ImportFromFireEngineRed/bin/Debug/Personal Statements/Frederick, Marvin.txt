The person who has had the most significant influence on my life has been my mother. She has also been responsible for shaping my life and giving me the desire to want to further my education after high school.  My mother gave up a thirteen year career in the United States Air Force to take care of my sister and me and to keep us together growing up. She instilled good work ethic, determination and dedication to achieve my goals by staying focused. My mother has always put my sister and me first and led by example how to live and be successful by putting God first.My mother has seven other siblings with children who have successfully attended college and on their way to great careers. I have been fortunate to have good role models around me but most of all living in the house with me on a daily basis, my mother. Being my best and doing my best has been a way of life for me although I have fallen short at times. My mother always remind me that things don’t always work as planned but you have to get up and keep trying and keep positive goals to reach.  She always says, “A man without vision is a man set for failure.” As a result of that belief, my mother allowed me to change schools in my senior year because she believed in my abilities and what I could achieve when others did not.My life has been shaped by a mother with values, determination, dedication and a team player in this challenge called life. Everyday is a chance to be better and do better than the day before and to help someone else.  My mother always says, “People are a product of their environment.” I come from a loving extended family and friends who support each other in their endeavors in life. I will always be thankful for my mother and the life she has given me.
