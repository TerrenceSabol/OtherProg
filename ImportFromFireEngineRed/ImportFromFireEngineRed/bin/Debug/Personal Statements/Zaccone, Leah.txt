SatisfiedLeah ZacconeDrinking, partying, and boys. That’s what I looked for to fill what I thought I could never fill. About a year ago I didn’t care, about anything; God was a joke, life was just a period of time; I just wanted to have fun. I grew up in a, cough, cough, “Christian home”, but being a Christian never really made sense to me after being around the things I was around. I guess I always thought there was a god, but he didn’t care about me and I never wanted him; why would I want a god that lets your parents get divorced or your father hit you? If I believed in God, then I’d have to live a typical Christian life-- a dull, goody-goody, boring life, and give up the life I was leading of dulling my pain with a bottle. I thought I was living large. Partying on the weekends, lying to my parents, whatever; but I was empty and hurting; everything else just helped numb the pain. Like my every Saturday night, I was on my way to some random party, but this time on the way there, my phone rang. My heart almost stopped when I heard the high pitched voice jumping at me through the static and loud background music. Moving the phone back away from my hot cheek, I saw the name “Cara Evans” flashed in bright blue lights on the screen. I did not want to talk to her. But it was too late. “Oh sh*t,” I huffed before putting  the phone back up to my cheek, “Uh, hello?”“Leah ?” the voice asked squeakily on the other end of the phone,“How are you? What are you doing? I haven’t talked to you all summer,” Cara rambled. I didn’t know what to say. “I, uh, I’m good, just with friends in the car,” I reached behind me and swatted at the peanut gallery sitting in my backseat dancing and still singing Donald Trump by Mac Miller.  “Next weekend you’re going with me to Carolina Point for YL camp, okay? Okay! Well call me if you need anything. I just wanted to say hey,” she said. “I-I- wait.” I was only talking to the dial tone. By the time I hung up the phone, she’d already suckered me into going on some weekend long trip with Young Life, a non-church lead youth group.            I’d done Young Life for a while, but only because my friends did it, and they never seemed to really care if you didn’t believe in God. I’d gone on the trips before, but not like this; this time only three of my friends were going. And Cara. I knew Cara knew about what I’d been doing, I’d only been plastering photos of myself holding a red Solo cup with a guy with his arm around me on my Facebook page for the past two years. But I didn’t want to talk to her about it. I didn’t want anyone to tell me I wasn’t okay. We all rode in separate cars together; I made sure I was not in Cara’s car, so I hopped into a car with another guy leader and two of my friends. As soon as I got into the car I poured myself into my phone- blasting Wiz Khalifa music through my tangled brand new headphones. With my luck, my phone died while we still had another hour left in the car, so I was forced to make conversation with the others in the car. God this, and God that are all they talked about… I wanted to die.            When we finally got to Carolina Point, we all had to sleep in tents. I had to be in a tent with four girls. And Cara. It was going to be a long weekend. For a while I just walked around the camp and hung out with people I knew from other schools and hardly ever saw Cara. I would play pool with the guys until Cara came inside, then I’d duck outside and go play soccer in the big fields next to the main building. I thought the weekend was just going to be like that first night for a while, me hiding from Cara. We all piled into the large game room for Young Life Club, which is just a lot of singing, dancing, and games with a sermon at the end. It was one of my favorite parts of Young Life and I just zoned out during the sermons. But this time something was different. I was not having fun. I didn’t want to jump around and sing and dance; my stomach felt empty, but I wasn’t hungry. It was a strange kind of empty. Like the feeling you get when you know something bad is about to happen. Or that feeling you get when you’re alone; just empty. During the sermon I thought I felt like I’d been punched in the face. I was not happy, I was hurting and I wanted more. The speaker, Steve, talked about the Prodigal Son, Luke 15:20-21,  “But while he was still a long way off, his father saw him and was filled with compassion for him; he ran to his son, threw his arms around him and kissed him. “The son said to him, ‘Father, I have sinned against heaven and against you. I am no longer worthy to be called your son.’ “God satisfies, He is all you need,” said Steve… God satisfies.            In the morning we were made to go out alone and have “God time”. We all left from the main building and were supposed to go read our Bibles and pray. I didn’t know what to do and I was the only one without a Bible. Cara tapped me on the shoulder and handed me a little orange bible and a small piece of notebook paper. I started rummaging through the tiny thing and flipped through Proverbs and finished reading the story of the Prodigal Son. Proverbs 3:6, “In all your ways acknowledge Him, And He will make your paths straight.” I was done. I was done trying to fix things for myself. I was done trying to make right the things I’d done wrong; I realized that I couldn’t do any of the things I wanted to do if I kept pushing God away. I pulled Cara aside and we sat in the grass, before I said anything she put her hand on my knee and said, “He’s already forgiven you, whatever it is, He’s forgiven you.” Tears of grace ran down my sinner face. She held my hand as I walked into the arms of Christ. 2 Corinthians 5:17, “Therefore, if anyone is in Christ they are a new creation, the old has gone, the new has come”. Cara talked to me about repenting from my sins, and right there while still sitting in the grass and while pushing my soggy face into her arms I gave my life back to Christ. Cara and I talked the whole ride home. This time I made sure I could ride with her. She continued to talk to me about how God puts crappy things in our lives sometimes to break us so we see that the only way we can stand up again, is if He picks us up. Everything made sense now. God didn’t break me because He’s evil. I was just too stubborn to give in any other way. When I got home, I sat in my room and stared at the top shelf of my closet. Slowly I walked towards the open doors and pulled down a brown bag from the shelf and took it outside. Lord forgive me, I’m so sorry Father... Abba give me strength, the strength to follow you. When I got outside I opened the bag and pulled out a water bottle. I cracked the seal to be overtaken by the sharp smell of peach vodka. I turned the bottle upside down and waited for every drop to pour from the plastic container. I threw the bottle over the back fence and walked back inside.
