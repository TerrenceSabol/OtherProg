2010 was the year that began an era of many trials in my life.  My parents were divorcing, there were legal issues being dealt with, and I was losing most of the people I considered to be my true friends.  Everything seemed to be falling apart; for a long time I let these things affect my attitude about life.  My attitude was the factor that broke me and then made me.	Starting around the time I was fourteen years old until I was sixteen and a half, I was nothing but trouble.  I was having trouble dealing with my family situation, and it became an excuse for me to stop caring about school, following rules, or staying out of trouble.   My outlook on the world around me was definitely negative at that time.  I did things that contradicted my true beliefs, and I put myself in situations that were not only wrong but dangerous for a young girl.  School was the last thing on my mind and I could not have cared less about respecting my mom.  I did not consider the way she was being affected by all of the drama going on.  Life was at a really low point.  My attitude pulled me right down to rock bottom.  I was so hard-headed about the choices I was making; it took something as serious as seeing my step brother nearly dead of alcohol poisoning to speak to me and say �Hey, you�ve got to  step back and look at yourself.�	The minute I opened my eyes and realized that my attitude was dragging me down and hurting the people around me, I entered a transformation into the person I am today.  Slowly but surely, I started down the path towards success.  I began working up to my potential in school, got a job, and responsibilities became my first priority.  I learned to appreciate my mom even when we were not on the best terms.  Life has never meant more to me than it does now and all it took was a change of attitude.	One day I hope to become a counselor or social worker and help teenagers like myself who have given up because they do not know what else to do.  I would like to help them take their experiences and use them to better themselves in the same way that I was able to.  If I can make a difference in a young adult�s life and help them become stronger and avoid the wrong path, then I will have made my biggest dream come true.  Attitude is everything, and I am glad I learned that lesson before it was too late.
