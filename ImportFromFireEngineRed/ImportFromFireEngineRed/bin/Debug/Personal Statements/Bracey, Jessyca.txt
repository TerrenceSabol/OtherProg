My name is Jessyca Bracey, in this essay I will briefly tell you a little bit about myself. I was born on August 7, 1995 to Mary and Earl Bracey at Holy Cross Hospital. I have one sister named Jazmyne Bracey she is 21 years old and a niece that is 3 months old. I am 17 years old and this is my last year of high school finally. During my lifetime I have learned many things about myself that I love about myself and few things that I would like to change about myself. Over my lifetime we have had many visitors that came to stay at my house to get their lives together or get a better understanding of how good they actual had it or in other words a reality check. Recently we had my sister’s friend, Jasmine and her 4 year old daughter, Destini stay with us. She has been living here with my family for 2 years and about 3 weeks ago found a place to make their home. We also have my grandmother living with us, Mae Bell Shaw. We each take turns feeding, clothing and taking care of all her medical needs without any help from her other daughter and any other relatives.Now back to me; I have attended three elementary schools. I began education at Ardmore where I started kindergarten through third grade; I had so much fun their or so I remember.  My first weeks in kindergarten were the beginning of me singing. I started out in the children’s choir when I was 5 years old. During this time period I started becoming the lead and started singing solo’s in that choir. Nobody seemed really surprised that I could sing but me and my parents since my whole family on my father’s side can sing. I also joined Young People’s Division (YPD) at Seaton Memorial African Methodist Episcopal Church or AME Church for short, this organization was the beginning of who I am today. After my grandfather passed away my mother decided to join Reid Temple AME Church because the only reason why we said is because that was my father’s church home and that where half my family attend and also my mother only stayed because my grandfather asked her to. When he passed on my mother decide that it was time for a change. She believes that you go somewhere where you are going to be feed. She gave my sister and me one year to join the church also was a brownie in girls scouts.I transferred to Rockledge in the fourth grade I was 9 years. I started to attend there with my little cousins Zachary and Randal so I wasn’t alone.  My fourth grade year wasn’t the best year for me. I was being bullied and was afraid to say something about it and there wasn’t a lot of African Americans that were enrolled into this school. There was a lot of racism in that school when I was there. By this time I had transferred to my new church home Reid Temple AME Church where Rev. Dr. Lee P. Washington presides as Pastor. I had learned many things at this wonderful church such as the church might look big on the outside but on the inside its just one big church family. Since this church had gotten bigger I started to explore new and interesting things while keeping all my other interest alive. I continued to  sing and participate in YPD, joined daughters of faith and the dance ministry, I also attended youth service so that I could get a better understanding of what the preacher was teaching us. I guess the school board had a understanding that this wasn’t working they changed the zoning of the schools. I ended up at Glen Dale where I finished my elementary years. The good thing about changing schools was that I didn’t have to feel insecure about myself and it was in my neighborhood. During this time period I started to move forward and got more interested in music and began to play clarinet in 5th and 6th grade. While I enjoyed it I wanted to focus more on my school work rather than anything else. My middle school years were the best time period of my life. I went to Thomas Johnson Middle School both my 7th and 8th grade years. I got really focus and starting taking my education seriously which is another reason why I’m where I am today. I had a GPA of 3.75 and nothing was going to hold me back from where I was going. In 8th grade I picked back up my clarinet and thought it was time to go back to it and I was learning to play piano in school but I really wasn’t interested in it. It was the end of my 8th grade year and my parents decided to take me to a high school program fair. We went over to the International Baccalaureate table and they started as questions about the curriculum and how to get into the program. The people at the table asked what middle school I went to, they told them Thomas Johnson. “Those people said your daughter will never get into the program because I went to that school”. In other words let’s just say I got into the program and so did a few other students that went to Thomas Johnson.I’m finally in high school where it can make me or break me. That just means either I am going to do good in school where I can be successful in life or it can break me and I won’t make it out of school. The first high school I attended was Parkdale. I was inducted into the international Baccalaureate Program or IB for short. Where I learned to write essays. While I was there I continued to do concert band and joined the marching band for a while also joined the gospel choir, was a member of the freshman class SGA. I did a lot of fresh and thrilling items.After I decided I wanted to go in a different direction I transferred to the school I belonged to Duval home of the mighty tigers. This was the best school I ever been too, maybe because this was where everybody from TJ went. I attended Duval the rest of freshman and my sophomore year of high school. I was in three activities all at the same time. I would literally go from one rehearsal to the next then I go to cheerleading practice for the deration of practice. That took a lot of work to see that every practice and rehearsal has the right amount of time that it will need. While I was at Duval they were more understanding of I have to been in three places at once; seeing that two of the where classes and they were grades. Just imagine having a concert and you have to play and sing in both of them. Trust me it’s not fun you have to wear two different outfits. Keeping it moving though, Cheerleading is so fun especially since I’m the flyer I can do tricks in the air and also tumble and seeing the new routines and everything its exciting. I was MVP my 10th grade year. I was in the concert and gospel choir where we traveled to Georgia to compete in the six flags competition. We won first place as well. In church I’m still participating in all my activities except for dancing but I guess you could say I still dance because cheerleading includes dancing.  It was hard saying goodbye to Duval. I knew it was time to move on to better and things that will benefit in my future. With that said my last school is Bladensburg. I transferred here because ever since I can remember I had always had a habit of playing in somebodies hair, learning what tools to use, what color goes with what face, what face goes with what cut. I have always wanted to become a cosmetologist.  I started out in this program my 11th grade year. We had been selected by State Board and by our teachers. Many people apply but only a few students get in. I have continued to cheer here at Bladensburg. I was also inducted into the National Honors Society and I became the historian in YPD. Every year I pass out thanksgiving and Christmas baskets to persons that doesn’t have the money to purchase these items themselves it’s just one my missionary work.  My 12th grade year is the best year ever I was elected Financial Secretary for the 2nd district Washington conference level for YPD. I love being in a leadership position because I know how to get the job done. By April I will be a fully license cosmetologist.
