A person who has had a significant influence on me I would have to say is my grandmother. My grandmother has a huge influence on me. She�s the one who I do for, without some of her guidance besides my mom I don�t know where I would possibly be. My grandmother is a hard working woman who works hard for everything she has. She�s beyond intelligent and has taught me a lot about life and learning how to be on your own and not depending on other people and to be able to do things for yourself. I tell my grandmother all the time that I�ll be the one who she will see graduating and continuing my education to higher standards. All I want is to be able to make my grandmother smile and be proud of me. When we have our life learning sessions she always influences me in such a positive way to want to be something in life and be able to take care of my own. Ive watched my grandmother struggle then work hard to be able to get back on her feet. All I ask for is positivity in my life and my grandmother gives me nothing but positive points. I respect everything she does and says so when she is talking I listen and take notes. So far all of her great influences on me have help me through life and any issue that Ive had. Being able to have somebody in your life that you�re close to influence positively is such a heart warming feeling. So I�m beyond proud to have her in my life and I�ll be even more proud to have her at my graduation watching me walk across the stage. I�ll thank her because without her influence on me I wouldnt be where I�m at in life now.
