Haley Griffith Significant InfluenceJanuary 1, 2013  In my life many people have had an influence on me, but only one person has had a significant influence on me.  His name is Ryan Young; he is a close family friend and has been there for me through everything. He is like a father figure to me. 	Four years ago my father passed away in a car accident, and Ryan Young was there for me from the beginning and still is today. Also after my father died my family decided that we close our family owned restaurant.  That was such a hard time.  Through that tough time, I blamed myself for my father’s death which it wasn’t any of my fault.  The reason Ryan Young has made a significant influence in my life is because after my father died, I became very depressed and didn’t care about anything anymore my father was my best friend.  But Ryan Young taught me even though someone very significant in my life passed away doesn’t mean I have to dwell on the past and do nothing with my life.  Ryan Young is my backbone with everything that has gone on in my life he has been there.       Another reason Ryan Young has made a significant influence on my life is that when it came to school work he was always making sure I did my schoolwork and got good grades.  He has and always be there for me to listen to anything I have to say. He has made a significant influence in my life because he is my backbone, my best friend, someone that is always there when you need them for anything. He gives the best advice in the world and he’s just an all-around great person.  I would have never made it this far in life without him right beside me, doing everything he possibly could to help me in this journey called life.   I finally realize how blessed I am too have somebody like Ryan to be here for me through everything and anything.  That is why Ryan Young has made a significant influence on me.
