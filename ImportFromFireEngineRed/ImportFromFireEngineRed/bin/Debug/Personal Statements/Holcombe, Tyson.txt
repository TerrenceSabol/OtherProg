Influential Leadership	I have heard many people talk about their biggest influences being a famous sports figure, a rapper, a past teacher, and even people they have never met but know of from all sorts of social media. But I have somebody much more convenient whom I’m able to speak and communicate to whenever I need him or have a question to help progress me through my life; and this person is my Dad. He’s my biggest influence for many reasons, some of which seem small and some are comprehendible. For one thing, most kids now don’t have a father figure in their life or home, so they don’t have certain guidance and views that only a dad can provide them with. Another reason would definitely have to be the way he has raised me in the way that God has asked to raise a son. The last reason I’m going to mention would have to be simply because of the support he shows in absolutely everything that I do, whether it’s involving sports, school, girls, and life in Christ. I don’t know where I would be right now if he had not pushed me so hard to do well in life.	Most kids my age and younger, especially those in the African American ethnic background, are having to grow up not knowing their father, their father walking out, or even him dying while the child is young. Knowing this fact alone is what makes me appreciative for being able to come home after a long day and a hard practice and know that I can just open up to him and tell him exactly how my day went and he just listen and give advice on how to handle it all. When my dad was twelve his father died and he had to grow up looking up to his older cousins for a figure, so he told himself that he would never have that happen for his own kids and be here every step of the way. Me and my dad are extremely close, which is why I’m able to come to him about anything I want or need and he will just sit me down and we’ll talk whatever it is out and find the best solution. He always ensures that I have a positive mindset when solving an issue no matter what it may be, like when I’ve had a bad practice and just feel mad at the world then he’ll notice that I’m not acting like my usual self and he will calm me down and talk me through it so I can bring the positive aspect out of it and walk away happy. The same goes for school as well with all the work and projects.	Another reason he’s a big influence, which the majority of people tend to leave out when contemplating an influential interest, would be his strong faith in God and how he does his best to have our household as one body to better serve Him. He continually tells me and my sister that if anything secular that isn’t used to serve and represent God that we should be rid of it so blessings can begin and continue to enter and accumulate as we grow physically and spiritually. We grew up in the church, yet that phrase is so misused and taken the wrong way, I was taught the Ten Commandments at a young age so I have those rules that God laid upon the Earth, as well as common sense and the knowledge to know what’s right and what’s wrong. I’m glad that I was raised this way because it gives me a better state of mind to where if I see people doing something that they know is wrong that I can get away from it and avoid anything that could potentially hurt my future or harm the name of my family.	The biggest reason that he is my biggest influence would definitely have to be the support that he shows to me, my family, and all my friends that he knows. People come to my dad when they need something or want some spiritually advice or just somebody to talk to, so it’s nice to hear people ask me for his number whenever they want to talk to a male role model to them. For the sports that I’m in, my dad hasn’t missed a single football game or track meet, because he knows the feeling of not having any sort of support in any extracurricular event or school thing going on. For school, he pushes me to take certain classes that he knows I can succeed in and get a good grade in. I use to have a procrastination issue but he helped me catch onto it so he makes sure I handle all my work and try to get everything in on time. He seems to notice whenever I’m upset over practice more than anything else. Being a previous athlete in high school definitely helps us connect in a sense that when I’m hurt he knows it and talks me through it all and to go out the next day and respond to the challenge.	There are many different views on what or who influences people. Some things seem extreme and unreasonable, and some things make complete sense and it’s a background thing, you just have to understand where the person is coming from and how you think that they go through everyday life. My dad is the only doing I handle things the way I do, how I’ve personally progressed, and how God has really allowed me to see that I’m truly blessed, and that he makes ways out of no ways just so everybody can lift his name up and give all honor that’s due to him. So yeah, some dads are just there because it’s average and normal as a husband or a dad so they don’t show the level past love and compassion, but I can sit aside and know that my father loves me, wants the best for me, and only cares that my future goes the way that God would allow it and that I can be happy in the future with the decision I made in the present.
