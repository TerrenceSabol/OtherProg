Setting goals are extremely important to me as an individual. If I classify an event or future activity as a goal, it will become my top priority. My ultimate goal is to live a life that is pleasing and acceptable unto God. If God is not satisfied with the way I am living or with the direction that my life is headed, everything I do will be in vain and that is not a tolerable action. For that reason, all my other goals and aspirations must be in coordination with pleasing God as well. If not, they must be put aside.When the time approaches, I am determined to be a successful adult. I am striving for a career in the United States Air Force as an officer. The Air Force will provide me with a stable career, a paycheck, and the opportunity to travel and see many regions of the world. I know the process of achieving that dream requires a lot of hard work and dedication; but I am more than willing to do everything it takes to get there. I started working on this goal two years ago when I joined Junior ROTC in the tenth grade. My ROTC unit, along with my instructors, has provided me with an abundant amount of background knowledge about the military. I have been informed through my instructors that the road to becoming an officer in the military is a very challenging process, but it is also well worth the effort.In most instances, a high school diploma is no longer efficient enough to provide an individual with a comfortable, enjoyable life. A college education is an extremely important asset to have for planned success. This time next year, I plan to attend college. Attending college is essential, as it is necessary in order to become a military officer. I am planning to attend a public four year university at which I will be able to receive the quality education that I need to succeed in todayâ€™s society. College enrollment will allow me to continue my education, meet new people from different walks of life, and make life-long friendships. I do not expect college to be easy, nor do I expect anyone to simply hand me a degree. I am continuously preparing myself each day for college by strengthening my study habits and seeking advice from others who have previously excelled in post high school education. Daily, I strive to be satisfied with the individual that I have become thus far. True happiness cannot be bought, but starts within. No matter what circumstances or obstacles I must face, I am determined to wear a smile upon my face and be comfortable with who I am. In order to achieve my goals, I must be content with myself. Otherwise, I will not be able to focus on the positive aspects of life, nor will I be able to achieve or perhaps surpass my dreams.
