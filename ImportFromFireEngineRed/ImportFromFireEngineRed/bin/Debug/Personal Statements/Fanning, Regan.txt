George Bailey from Its a Wonderful Life inspired me because he never cares about himself. Its always about someone he cares about, or even someone he doesnt know, but hes always kind. In the end of the movie, Georges brother Harry comes home from the war with a medal. Georges uncle has misplaced all the money that their business has and the bank examiner is going to send him to jail. All the people gather to Georges house to pay him all the money they have because he is such a good person. Harry says, To my brother George, the richest man in town, and he isnt talking about money. Harold Potter is the richest man in town, but hes also the meanest. George has all of his friends and family and everyone in the whole town supporting him. I would love to be like George Bailey because he is kind, compassionate, thoughtful and loved. I believe that if everyone was like George Bailey there would be no war, no violence, no cruelty and no bullying. That is why I want to be like George Bailey.I believe I am like George Bailey because I always think of myself after thinking of other people. I hate to be mean and I try to be everyones friend. I stick up for people I dont know and I help everyone out that I can.I would like to be more like George Bailey in that I want to be more of a leader. I hope to someday run my own company that can help thousands of people get through their daily lives. I want to be more of an achiever and give off more self confidence. I want people to look up to me and have the answers for hard decisions. Of all the people I could be, I want to be George Bailey.
