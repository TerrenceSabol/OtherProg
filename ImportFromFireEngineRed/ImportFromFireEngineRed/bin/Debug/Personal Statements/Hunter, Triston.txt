Someone who has influenced me and became a significant role model in my life would have to be my grandfather. He was a strong, independent, heart driven man who was always there if I had ever needed him. I believed him to be one of the strongest individuals I had ever met. On the morning of December 14, 2012, he passed of lung cancer and a brain infection. As he passed away, I knew that he wasnt leaving me, but instead showing me that I shouldnt be afraid to be alone and to have to do things by myself. He taught me to be a better person.
