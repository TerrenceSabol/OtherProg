In your life there is that one person who has a great influence on you and the choices you make. You often look up to this person, even desire to be more like them. For me this person is a family friend named Katrina. Katrina is a great woman. She is a dedicated church member, never misses a sunday. She is very giving, always does what she can to help anyone putting everyones needs before hers.She donates all of her old things to charity has food drives at church even started a food bank at our church. I spend as much time with Katrina as i possibly can. I enjoy being with her helping all of the less fortunate people that need our help. It gives me a great feeling inside. She influences me to make the right choices in my life. Katrina also chooses to talk to me when i make the wrong choices. Her influence over me in my life has made me be a better person today.
