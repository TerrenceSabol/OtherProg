Many people influence my life but the person who has the biggest influence would have to be my dad. My dad is the hardest working man that I know and he never gives up an anything. He’s been a great role model for me and someone I would like to become one day. He’s shown me the importance of working hard and always being the best at everything that you do. He’s influenced me to be better then him and to always set goals for myself. He has his own eighteen wheeler and he is trying to start up his own business. That has taught me to never get complacent there is always room for improvement. He’s taught me to be a family man and to always provide for my family. Be able to support my wife and kids but don’t over work myself so that my family never sees me. Know how to balance work and family at the same time. He has influenced me to go to school and get an education because an education is the most important thing to have in life. An education will take you places in life you never taught you would see. It will help you do things in life you didn’t think was possible at first. He’s also taught me that no matter what life may throw my way fight through it and make the best of it. Always keep your head up and don’t let anyone stop you from achieving your goals. No matter what challenges I endure keep fighting and overcome those challenges. Just give it your all and never give up. Life wont be easy but make the best of it. Live life and be happy in whatever I decide to do in life. Those are the things he has told me and words that will always stick with me.
