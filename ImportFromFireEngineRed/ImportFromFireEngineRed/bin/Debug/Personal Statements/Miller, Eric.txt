I am Eric Miller.  That is the name I was given at birth; however, my experiences, accomplishments and aspirations make me who I am.  I have always wanted to be known for something positive.      I began playing sports in middle school and made sure to become a valuable asset.  I continued playing sports in high school.  Team values and the ability to work as a group to achieve a goal were valuable lessons.  I enjoyed playing Lacrosse.  I was most improved player my first year and continued on to Most Valuable player the following two years in a row.  In my fourth year playing lacrosse, I was made team Captain and was honored with The Charlie Guy, Jr. leadership award.    I have volunteered a total of 160 hours on community projects including a special trip to the Dominican Republic. I also volunteer at my church as a chalice bearer.  I saw my world in a different way after the mission trip to the Dominican Republic.  I saw people who had nothing go out of their way to offer me some of their food.  I had no idea and did not expect this.  I learned first hand a valuable lesson.  It is a lesson we all might know but seldom follow.  The golden Rule or the �law of the prophets�- treat others, as you want to be treated.     I have an interest in law enforcement.  It is a great way to contribute to the community.  I grew up in a poor neighborhood in Tampa where I saw crime all the time.  Drug and gang activity and vandalism were the normal way.  I saw little to no action on the crimes being committed, and I saw how it affected the people around the neighborhood.  I moved to a better area in the eighth grade but I still remember.  I often think that I would like to be a detective and prove that police are here to keep people safe.  Attending a Military Academy has taught me discipline and self-respect.  I hold the rank of Captain and participate on the school drill team.  I have learned the way of the military and their values.  This value system has helped them stay as strong as they are now.  It has given me the tools to learn and the desire to achieve.
