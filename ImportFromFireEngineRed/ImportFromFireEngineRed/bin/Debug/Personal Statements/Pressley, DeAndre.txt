A person that has had a positive influence on me would be my mother. She is a strong person, and she raise me as a single parent. I thank her everyday for what she has done for me. My mom has made sure I stayed on top of my school work. My mom is my hero. Not a day goes by where I dont hug my mom. She is special and a beautiful lady. I wasnt always a perfect child and my mom made sure I had my head on straight. She has taught me to value the little things in life and appreciate everything I have. A quote my mother always told me was Be thankful for what you have; youll end up having more. If you concentrate on what you dont have, you will never, ever have enough.        My mother stress to to me more than anything. She told me never use not having a father around as an excuse. I never did and I never will! Imagine a person that has been there through thick and thin. When things arent always the best. Thats a strong woman to raise three boys alone with no help. Anyone that raises three teenagers alone should be put in a category by themselves. I will never take for granted life and she has taught me if I have a goal try to reach it, and never ever let someone tell you that you cant do something. Ive had that kind of attitude since I was a young child. I am very determine and I wont take no for an answer if I know its something I can do.      My mom is such a wonderful person and I love her so much. She looks at me and she sees a smart intelligent young man. I thank her everyday for being there for me everyday. No one will ever replace my mother. I will always continue to strive to reach my goals.
