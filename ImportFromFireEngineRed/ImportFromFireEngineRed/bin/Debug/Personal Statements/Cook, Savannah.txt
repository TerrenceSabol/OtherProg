People that are the closest to you are the ones who are going to have the most impact on your life. My mom is that person for me. My mom is the best person anyone could ask for many reasons, but most importantly to me is that it doesnt matter how small the problem is, she would take time out to take care of it. Ever since I was little, if I had a certain kind of look on my face, she would stop whatever she was doing and ask if everything was “okay,” and if it wasnt, she would sit down with me and we would talk through it. She would even know if I wasnt feeling good, just by the way I looked and she would do everything in her power to make me feel better. Often it would be just sitting down and holding me tight until I fell asleep. Peaceful, safe, loved, and comfortable, that is what my mom makes me feel.She is the strongest person that I know. Her strength comes from her life experiences: she is a single mom raising a teenage daughter, she has maintained a full time career, and she is also a colon cancer survivor for fifteen years.  All of these experiences have molded her into an emotionally strong woman.  Raising a teenage daughter, in these days and times, can be extremely taxing. Daughters have so many choices to make and she has given me a strong foundation, including love of our great country and faith-based principles, on which to make such choices. As a registered nurse, my mom cared for many people in the Intensive Care Units and Emergency Departments for more than 23 years. She has worked the many weekends, night shifts, and holidays in order to provide a home for me. For the past 11 years, my mom has worked for a company which has a contract with the Medicare program and she works with the Medicare beneficiaries and their families in assisting them with the healthcare system. Lastly, as a colon cancer survivor, she has walked that road of radical surgery and post-operative tests, appointments, and treatments until that day her doctor told her that wonderful news, “no more cancer.” My mom can also hand out constructive criticism when it is needed. One of my passions in life is the game of indoor volleyball and my mom has been to nearly every match I have played for six years. She has volunteered and worked many aspects of a volleyball match, from the concession stands, to taking money at the gate, and finally learning how to “score” matches and did so for nearly all of my high school matches.  Many people might think that my mom is harsh in her constructive criticism, but, I don’t. She gives me objective, constructive, and honest information in order for me to become a better player and I wouldnt want her any other way.
