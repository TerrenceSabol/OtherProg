I live in a low income so my family doesnt have money for me to go to college. The money I saved up is all I have to put towards college, beside taking out loans. I really want to be able to make my family proud and a great role model for my younger sibilings. I really need this scholarship because I know that all my hard work will have to pay off. I have to go to college because I know that I have been through a lot of things and I want to try to help myself have a better life then that.
