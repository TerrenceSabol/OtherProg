One of the best football coaches in the history of the game, Bear Bryant, once said “I make my practices real hard because if a player is a quitter, I want him to quit in practice, not in a game.” As quarterback of my high school football team, I have been a part of many tough practices in the Florida heat. After going through many of those difficult practices, I became truly dedicated to my team and our goals.	Through football I have developed a great work ethic that is necessary to become successful at anything. So by transferring this work ethic from the football field to the classroom, it has enabled me to become a better student. As one of the captains of my team, my job is to understand my coaches objectives so that I can push my teammates during our practices. Translating this knowledge to my schoolwork, I master the lessons in my classes and then use the information not only on tests but to my life.	Another key attribute one must have to become a successful football player is persistence. Everyday I have to practice with the same effort I put out on game night. In order to become great it is important that plays become second-nature to me because I have practiced them so many times I dont have to think about the fundamentals. In school, if I continuously study and do homework, then when tests come around they are never difficult to handle.	Football has always been more than a game to me, because it has taught me many life lessons such as having a great work ethic, persistence and the importance of being a part of a team. I am aware of the different strains on a college student and the need to balance studies with other interests.  I will use my past experiences to carry over to my continued success at Newberry College.
