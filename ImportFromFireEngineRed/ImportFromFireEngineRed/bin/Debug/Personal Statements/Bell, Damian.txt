Coach Sean Glover. A Godly, honest, and trustworthy man that has made a major impact on my life. Coach Glover has advised me through numerous situations, he coached me at runningback, and he assists me with my walk with Christ. Because of his heroic influences, I am becoming a successful man.     Growing up as a teen you go through a lot and you may struggle at times. For example, many teens are pressured, grew up in a bad environment, have made the wrong decisions, and then you have those with tough skin. Me personally, I fall in the category of having tough skin. The ones with tough skin are smart, strong, and can also think on their feet. Coach Glover plays a major role in that process. He lended his ear to me when I needed to talk, corrected me in my wrong doings, and has been a father figure in my life. Not many people are blessed to have someone like that in their life but Im very thankful.     Coaching is something that Coach Glover does very well and he has coached me at runningback. Coach Glover had a style of hardwork and dedication so I fitted in just fine. He would give you numerous reputations at different things to test you, he watches the little things you right as well as wrong, and etc. What really stood out the most was that he did not only help you prepare for football games but he helped you prepare for life. Now that is something many people could agree on when it comes to him. At the end of the day, he has not only helped to improve your performance, but he has helped you you improve your inner person.     Lastly, your walk with Christ is very important for everyone. It determines where you are going to be when you depart from this Earth. Now Coach Glover is a wise man that has not only helped me but others as well. He would send you a text every night with a Bible scripture attached for you to read and study. I mean every night, he will not forget nor let you down. To be honest, I have no clue of how he do this everyday for numerous people with no hesitation. That takes pride and dedication and that is something special that many people do not have. But like I have stated, he is a great person.    As you can see, Coach Glover is a honest, Godly, and trustworthy man that has made a major impact on my life. His heroic ways touches many people and I know that for a fact. Words can not describe how much I thank him and I Pray that many more people could experience a great person like that in their life.
