They can form and reform throughout your personal and professional life whether it is learning or maybe experiencing. I will discuss my personal values which include volunteering, achievements, and honesty. I always like the thought of helping someone out, whether it was helping my mother in the kitchen or even helping a friend with homework. Being a volunteer at Spartanburg Methodist College for the last 2 years, I have learned so much about myself. I realized that I am blessed to have what I have. Some people are less fortunate and I would do anything to help them out. I have helped make soup last year for the Soup Kitchen and I have also volunteered to work in a little food diner at Lions Booth Fair for the both years of college. Volunteering really helped me grow as a person and I will continue to help others. I have achieved many things in my life. I graduated high school, I am going to college and I also work at a restaurant for the past year. Sometimes I get overwhelmed and frustrated cause of the fact that I work and go to school at the same time, but I keep remembering that I am doing better for myself, so I continue to work hard at both situations. I balance them out by staying focus and planning a schedule. I am evening thinking about getting another job, so I can start saving money and budgeting myself. If I get accepted to Newberry, I will continue to try my best and achieve even goals in my life.  Honesty is one of the most important values. I think everyone should be honesty with themselves, as well as with others. I believe that being honesty is a lot more relaxing towards yourself because if you lie, then you have to lie more to cover yourself and then you start believing it. It is stressful and it can make your life harder than what it is. So, hopefully I will get a chance to attend Newberry, and continue to work towards my goals of being a preschool teacher and/or a graphic designer.
